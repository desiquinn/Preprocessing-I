  My Story
  In the early 90s my grandmother introduced me to coding.  I was just 12 years old when I taught myself HTML and CSS. When I went to college I landed my first Jr. Web Designer job at Western Carolina University.  Later I was recruited to design and manage the website for WCU's Women's Center.  Eventually I earned my Bachelor's Degree in Biology and began working in medicine, research, and sales.  Still something was missing in my life.  After some thought I realized that Web Development had been my true passion all along. I am not a Lambda School student modernizing my exsisting skills and learning new ones to become a full stack web developer.
